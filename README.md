EquivalencyTech (EquiTech) is an attempt to recreate elements of the [ProjectE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/projecte) mod.

## Features
The plugin currently features:
* EMC!
  * Turn any unwanted items into EMC
  * Synthesize your stored EMC into any other item you want!
  * Server owners have full control over the base EMC values of items
  * Items that are crafted have their EMC generated based off of these base values (e.g. Diamond = 1000 emc, Diamond Block will automatically be 9000)
  * Server owners can override this behavior if required by adding the item into the base.
* Transmutation Orb
  * This key item lets users input their unwanted items to convert them to EMC.
  * The first time a new item is added, it is 'learned'.
  * Learned items can be synthesized using stored EMC.

## Planned Features
* Automation
  * Condenser Chest
    * Any items input into the chest are dissolved into EMC. Starting at a 50% return on EMC ranging to 100% through upgrades
  * Synthesizer Chest
    * After being assigned an item, synthesizes items using the assigning player's EMC periodically into the chest. This will be upgradable to increase the rate at which items are generated.
* Slimefun
  * As at this first release, only vanilla items + EquiTech items can be condensed / synthesized. A Future update will allow for Slimefun core items to also be added.
* DankTech
  * The addition of a new type of pack to DankTech that converts voided items into EMC with a % loss

A big shout out to the owners of [mct.tantrum.org](https://mct.enjin.com/) who let me test on their server even once it was clear I barely knew what I was doing! <3
